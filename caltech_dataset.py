        - Here you should implement the logic for reading the splits files and accessing elements
        - If the RAM size allows it, it is faster to store all data in memory
        - PyTorch Dataset classes use indexes to read elements
        - You should provide a way for the __getitem__ method to access the image-label pair
          through the index
        - Labels should start from 0, so for Caltech you will have lables 0...100 (excluding the background class)
